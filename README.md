This is a small PoC application used to detect possible sideloading vulnerabilities during build time.
The great thing about is that it can be integrated into practically every automated build process.

It is heavily based on [Noriben sandbox](https://github.com/Rurik/Noriben) and [Process Monitor](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx).
